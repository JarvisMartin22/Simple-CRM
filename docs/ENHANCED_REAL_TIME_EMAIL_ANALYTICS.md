# Enhanced Real-Time Email Analytics

## Overview

This document describes the enhanced email tracking and analytics system that provides real-time insights into email campaign performance. The system tracks email opens, clicks, bounces, and other engagement metrics, displaying them in comprehensive dashboards with live updates.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Real-Time Email Tracking
- **Email Opens**: Tracking pixel records each email open with timestamp and user agent
- **Link Clicks**: Tracked links record click events and redirect to original URLs
- **Event Storage**: All events stored in `email_events` table for historical analysis
- **Automatic Analytics**: Campaign analytics automatically updated when events occur

### 2. Campaign Analytics Dashboard
- **Live Updates**: Dashboard refreshes every 30 seconds for real-time data
- **Performance Metrics**: Open rates, click rates, bounce rates with visual indicators
- **Engagement Charts**: Time-series charts showing opens/clicks over time
- **Recipient Analysis**: Individual recipient tracking and activity history
- **Link Performance**: Click tracking for specific links within campaigns

### 3. Platform-Wide Analytics
- **Aggregate Insights**: Combined analytics across all campaigns
- **Trend Analysis**: 7-day engagement trends with visual charts
- **Top Campaigns**: Performance ranking of campaigns by open/click rates
- **Recent Activity**: Live feed of email engagement events
- **Summary Metrics**: Total campaigns, sends, opens, clicks across platform

### 4. Data Flow & Processing
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Tracking events trigger analytics updates
- **Edge Functions**: Supabase edge functions handle tracking with sub-second response
- **Database Optimization**: Proper indexing and RLS policies for performance
- **Real-Time Aggregation**: Analytics calculated from live event data

## Architecture

### Database Schema

#### Core Tables
- `email_events`: Primary event storage for all email interactions
- `campaign_analytics`: Aggregated statistics per campaign
- `email_tracking`: Individual email tracking records
- `tracked_links`: Link-specific tracking data
- `recipient_analytics`: Per-recipient engagement metrics

#### Key Relationships
```sql
campaigns (1) -> (*) email_events
campaigns (1) -> (1) campaign_analytics
email_tracking (1) -> (*) tracked_links
contacts (1) -> (*) email_events (via recipient_id)
```

### Edge Functions

#### 1. Email Tracker (`/functions/v1/email-tracker`)
- **Purpose**: Records email opens via tracking pixel
- **Response**: 1x1 transparent GIF image
- **Processing**: Updates `email_tracking`, creates `email_events`, refreshes `campaign_analytics`
- **Performance**: Sub-100ms response time

#### 2. Link Tracker (`/functions/v1/link-tracker`)
- **Purpose**: Records link clicks and redirects users
- **Response**: 302 redirect to original URL
- **Processing**: Updates `tracked_links`, creates `email_events`, refreshes analytics
- **Security**: Validates tracking IDs and URLs

#### 3. Refresh Analytics (`/functions/v1/refresh-campaign-analytics`)
- **Purpose**: Manually refresh campaign analytics from events
- **Response**: JSON with updated analytics
- **Processing**: Aggregates all events for a campaign into summary metrics
- **Usage**: Called automatically by dashboard and manually via refresh button
