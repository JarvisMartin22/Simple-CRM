# Gmail Authentication Fix Summary

## Issue
The Gmail integration was failing with a 401 Unauthorized error when calling the `gmail-auth` edge function. The error occurred even though the code was attempting to pass authentication headers.

## Root Cause
The Supabase client's `functions.invoke` method wasn't consistently including the authentication headers, especially when the session was refreshed or when there were multiple Supabase client instances.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Duplicate Variable Error
- Fixed the Vite compilation error by renaming the duplicate `sessionError` variable to `sessionError2` in `useGmailConnect.ts`

### 2. Created Enhanced Supabase Client
- Created `/src/lib/supabaseWithAuth.ts` that wraps the Supabase client
- This wrapper ensures auth headers are always included when calling edge functions
- Automatically gets the current session and adds the Authorization header

### 3. Updated Hook to Use Enhanced Client
- Modified `useGmailConnect.ts` to import and use `supabaseWithAuth`
- Removed manual header passing since the enhanced client handles it automatically
- Simplified the code by removing redundant auth header logic

## Testing

### Option 1: Debug Tool
1. Open http://localhost:8080/debug-gmail-auth.html
2. Make sure you're logged into the app
3. Click "Test Gmail Auth Function"
4. Should now see a successful response with the OAuth URL

### Option 2: Direct Test
1. Go to Settings > Integrations in your app
2. Click "Connect Gmail"
3. Should now open the Google OAuth popup without errors

## Key Files Modified
- `/src/hooks/useGmailConnect.ts` - Fixed duplicate variable and updated to use enhanced client
- `/src/lib/supabaseWithAuth.ts` - New file that ensures auth headers are included

## Edge Function Status
The `gmail-auth` edge function has been deployed and includes:
- Proper JWT verification
- Environment variables are correctly set
- Supports both OAuth flow initiation and code exchange

## Next Steps
1. Test the Gmail connection flow
2. If successful, the integration should save to the `user_integrations` table
3. You should be able to send emails through the Gmail integration
